    "- **Part 3**: Creating a new consolidated dataset of the Neighborhoods, along with their boroughs, crime data and the respective Neighbourhood's co-ordinates: This latitude and longitude data will be fetched using OpenCage Geocoder to explore the neighbourhood by plotting it on maps using Folium and perform exploratory data analysis.\n",
